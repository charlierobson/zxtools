# zxtools

## Two (count 'em) tools to help with cross-development of ZX81 programs.

### zxtool will:
* decompile a P file into its associated BASIC text
* dump variables and their content
* dump the SYSVARS
* remove a P file's auto-run
* force a P file to auto-run at a particular line number
* extract and insert arbitrary lines of code

### zxtext2p will:
* compile a text-based representation of a zeddy program into a standard P file
* allow development without line numbers, using a label-based system for GO(TO/SUB)

Binaries are available pre-compiled for [windows](https://github.com/charlierobson/zxtools/tree/master/bin-win) and [mac/linux](https://github.com/charlierobson/zxtools/tree/master/bin-mac).
